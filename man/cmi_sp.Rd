\title{Semiparametric conditional mean imputation (CMI) for a censored predictor}
\usage{
cmi_sp(
  imputation_model,
  lp = NULL,
  data,
  integral = "AQ",
  Xmax = Inf,
  subdivisions = 100L,
  surv_between = "cf",
  surv_beyond = "e"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{imputation_model}{Imputation model formula (or coercible to formula), a formula expression as for other regression models. The response is usually a survival object as returned by the \code{Surv} function. See the documentation for \code{Surv} for details.}

\item{lp}{(Optional) A vector of the linear predictors for the imputation model, in the same order as \code{data}. If \code{lp = NULL} (the default), the linear predictor is extracted from the fitted imputation model.}

\item{data}{Dataframe or named matrix containing columns \code{W}, \code{Delta}, and \code{Z}.}

\item{integral}{A string input for how to approximate the integral in the imputed values. Default is \code{integral="AQ"} for adaptive quadrature, but \code{"TR"} (trapezoidal rule) and \code{"A"} (quasi-analytical) are also available.}

\item{Xmax}{(Optional) Upper limit of the domain of the censored predictor. Default is \code{Xmax = Inf}.}

\item{subdivisions}{(Optional) Passed through to \code{integrate}, the maximum number of subintervals. Default is \code{subdivisions = 100L}.}

\item{surv_between}{A string for the method to be used to interpolate for censored values between events. Options include \code{"cf"} (carry forward, the default), \code{"wm"} (weighted mean), or \code{"m"} (mean).}

\item{surv_beyond}{A string for the method to be used to extrapolate the survival curve beyond the last observed event. Options include \code{"d"} (immediate drop off), \code{"e"} (exponential extension, the default), or \code{"w"} (weibull extension).}
}
\value{
\item{imputed_data}{A copy of \code{data} with added column \code{imp} containing the imputed values.}
\item{code}{Indicator of algorithm status (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}).}
}
